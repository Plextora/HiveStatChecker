# Hive Stat Checker
Hive Stat Checker is a utility Latite Client V2 plugin for checking the current leaderboard of a Hive game mode and for checking a player's stats in a game mode (for all the queue dodgers out there).

It does use Latite's module system, but the actual functionality uses its own command system from before Latite Scripting had commands
